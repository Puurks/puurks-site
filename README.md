# Code for Puurks Site
**my code is a mess dont make fun of me lmao**

* This website is an ongoing project that I've been working on since _4/4/24_.
* I switched from hosting the site on Neocities to Vercel, and in turn, created this repo on _11/20/24_.
* I bought the puurks.com domain on _12/25/24_.

This website is a passion project I designed to host my important social handles as well as to provide credit to all of the artists who I've commissioned and whose bases I've used.
